<h3>Super 30</h3>
This is the best movie that I have watched.It tells story of Anand Kumar,a maths teacher who taught poor students and get them into IIT, one of the topmost institutes in India.

<h3>Dhoom 3</h3>
This was the first movie I watched on my pc,and was story of a thief who theft so intelligently and helped the poor, and how police catches them.I was very fond of the thiefing methods but not so fond of the way they finally died.. I  literally cried at that moment.

<h3>The Kashmir Files</h3>
This movie I watched during lockdown and was so suprised knowing what happened to Kashmiri Pandits back post Independence Days in Kashmir. I cried watching that movie and felt the pain of Kahmiri pandits every second .I think everybody should watch that movie.
